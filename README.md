Hear4Less
=========

Seniors who have hearing loss have a hard time enjoying the company of their friends and family. They are also at high risk of accidents because they can’t hear danger. We’re making a low cost replacement for expensive hearing aids so seniors can afford the hearing help they need. Our plan has two parts. One, seniors will buy their own smartphone, Bluetooth headset, and directional microphone, which we estimate will be about $130. Two, we’re recruiting volunteer software developers to create a free app for seniors to use on their smartphone as the hearing aid processor.
